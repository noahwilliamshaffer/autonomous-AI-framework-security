# NEW TOOL IN RECON PIPELINE

Integrate **[TOOL_NAME]** into the RedAmon recon pipeline.

### Critical Rules

- **Python import safety**: The `recon_orchestrator` container volume-mounts source code (`./recon_orchestrator:/app`). Adding a new Python `import` that isn't already installed in the container image will **crash-loop** the service. Before importing any package, verify it exists in `recon_orchestrator/requirements.txt` or the `recon_orchestrator/Dockerfile`. If it's missing, add it and rebuild: `docker compose build recon-orchestrator`.
- **Don't break existing tools**: Adding a new tool must NOT modify the behavior, output format, or settings of any existing tool. If you change a shared file (e.g., `recon/project_settings.py`, `recon/main.py`), verify that all existing tools still work after your changes.
- **Container restart rules**: The `recon_orchestrator` container volume-mounts code — changes are live immediately. The `recon` container is built fresh per scan job, so Dockerfile changes require `docker compose build recon`. Frontend changes require `docker compose build webapp`.
- **Build/restart quick reference**:
  - Changed `recon/Dockerfile` or `recon/entrypoint.sh` → `docker compose build recon`
  - Changed `recon_orchestrator/*.py` → `docker compose restart recon-orchestrator`
  - Changed `recon/*.py` → no restart needed (spawned fresh per job), but rebuild if Dockerfile changed
  - Changed `webapp/prisma/schema.prisma` → `docker compose exec webapp npx prisma db push`
  - Changed `webapp/src/**` → `docker compose build webapp && docker compose up -d webapp`

### Phase 1: Research (do NOT write code yet)

1. **Tool research** — Search the tool's official documentation, GitHub repository, and README online. Determine:
   - **Integration type**: Does it have an official Docker image? A Python/Go library? A REST API? Is it CLI-only?
   - **Is it passive or active?** (passive = queries third-party APIs/databases only, active = sends traffic to target)
   - **Dependencies**: Does it need external binaries, wordlists, resolver lists, config files?
   - **API keys**: Does it use API keys? Can it run without them?

2. **Tool output** — Based on the integration type determined above, test the tool and capture its **exact output schema**:
   - If Docker image available: run `docker run <image> -h` to study all CLI flags, then run a real query against a safe target (e.g., `example.com`) with JSON output enabled to capture field names, types, and structure.
   - If API-based: study the API docs, endpoints, request/response schemas.
   - If Python library: study the package docs and return types.

3. **Choose integration pattern** — Based on the research above, match to the existing codebase patterns:
   - **Docker-in-Docker** (Naabu, httpx, Katana, Nuclei, GAU): `subprocess.run(['docker', 'run', '--rm', ...])` — see `recon/port_scan.py`, `recon/resource_enum.py`
   - **Direct subprocess** (Knockpy): `subprocess.run(['toolname', ...])` — see `recon/domain_recon.py`
   - **API/HTTP calls** (crt.sh, HackerTarget, URLScan, Shodan): `requests.get(...)` — see `recon/domain_recon.py`, `recon/urlscan_enrich.py`, `recon/shodan_enrich.py`

   If the tool has an official Docker image, prefer Docker-in-Docker. If it's a simple API, use HTTP calls. Only use direct subprocess if the tool is a pip package already in the container.

3. **Identify the pipeline phase** — Read `recon/main.py` to understand the phase structure. Determine which phase the tool belongs to and where its results feed into.

4. **Settings multi-layer flow** — Every new setting must be added in ALL these layers (miss one and it breaks):
   - `webapp/prisma/schema.prisma` — field with `@default()` and `@map()` (camelCase field, snake_case DB column)
   - `recon/project_settings.py` → `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` dict (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE keys)
   - `recon/project_settings.py` → `fetch_project_settings()` mapping (camelCase from DB → SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for Python)
   - `recon_orchestrator/api.py` → `GET /defaults` endpoint (include in served defaults)
   - `recon_orchestrator/api.py` → `RUNTIME_ONLY_KEYS` set (only if the setting should NOT appear in defaults)
   - Frontend section component (with fallback default in `onChange`)
   - **Naming convention**: `tool_setting` (DB column) → `toolSetting` (Prisma/frontend) → `TOOL_SETTING` (Python)

5. **Frontend settings page** — Study `webapp/src/components/projects/ProjectForm/ProjectForm.tsx` to find which tab the tool belongs to. Study existing section components in `webapp/src/components/projects/ProjectForm/sections/` — each has: collapsible header, toggle, description, badges (Passive/Active), conditional parameter inputs, and `NodeInfoTooltip` from `nodeMapping.ts`. Study how API key checks work in `ShodanSection.tsx` and `UrlscanSection.tsx` if the tool needs keys.

6. **API key handling** — Determine if the tool uses API keys (for external data sources, premium features, higher rate limits, etc.). If yes: check if the tool works **without** API keys (degraded/limited mode) and **with** them (full coverage). Follow the existing pattern: API keys are stored in the `UserSettings` model in Prisma (global, per-user, NOT per-project). At runtime, fetch via `_fetch_user_api_key()` in `recon/project_settings.py` using `?internal=true` for unmasked values. In the frontend section component, check key status via `/api/users/{userId}/settings` and show an info banner (like `ShodanSection.tsx` and `UrlscanSection.tsx` do): if key is set, use it; if empty, tool runs without it (reduced results but still functional). Study `webapp/src/app/api/users/[id]/settings/route.ts` for the GET/PUT pattern and the key masking logic.

7. **Graph DB integration** — Read `readmes/GRAPH.SCHEMA.md` for the full node/relationship schema. Study `graph_db/neo4j_client.py` — find the `update_graph_from_*()` method closest to the new tool's output type. Understand MERGE keys (always `(name/address, user_id, project_id)`), `ON CREATE SET` vs unconditional `SET`, and deduplication with existing nodes from other tools.

8. **RoE (Rules of Engagement) scope** — Study how the RoE settings affect tool execution. Check `recon/main.py` and the RoE tab in `ProjectForm.tsx` to understand how scope restrictions (allowed domains, IPs, excluded targets) are enforced. Determine if the new tool's output could include out-of-scope results (e.g., subdomains of unrelated domains, IPs outside allowed ranges) and ensure results are filtered against the RoE before being stored. Study how existing tools handle scope filtering — e.g., `domain_recon.py` splits results into in-scope `subdomains` vs out-of-scope `external_domains`.

9. **Output format** — Study how the tool's results merge into the combined recon JSON output in `recon/main.py`. Determine if results extend an existing section (e.g., subdomains into `discover_subdomains()` return) or need a new section in the combined output.

10. **Parallelization opportunities (fan-out / fan-in)** — Study the execution flow in `recon/main.py` and determine whether the new tool can run **in parallel** with other tools in the same phase. Look for:
   - **Fan-out**: Can this tool be launched concurrently with other independent tools that share the same inputs? For example, multiple subdomain discovery sources (crt.sh, HackerTarget, Subfinder) all take the root domain as input and can run simultaneously. If the new tool has no dependency on the output of another tool in the same phase, it should fan out alongside them (e.g., using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` or `asyncio.gather`).
   - **Fan-in**: After parallel execution, results from multiple tools must be merged/deduplicated before the next phase consumes them. Determine how the new tool's results join the fan-in point — does it contribute to an existing aggregation (e.g., a shared `subdomains` set) or require a new merge step?
   - **Dependencies that block parallelization**: If the tool depends on results from a prior tool (e.g., port scanning needs discovered hosts, URL crawling needs live subdomains), it must wait for that phase to complete — do NOT parallelize across dependency boundaries.
   - Check existing parallel patterns in the codebase and follow the same executor/threading approach rather than introducing a new concurrency mechanism.

### Phase 2: Implementation checklist

- [ ] Tool runner function in the appropriate `recon/*.py` file
- [ ] Settings keys in `recon/project_settings.py` (`DEFAULT_SETTINGS` + `fetch_project_settings()` mapping)
- [ ] Prisma schema fields in `webapp/prisma/schema.prisma`
- [ ] Run `docker compose exec webapp npx prisma db push` (never use `prisma migrate`)
- [ ] Docker image added to `recon/entrypoint.sh` IMAGES array (if Docker-based)
- [ ] Docker image setting (e.g. `TOOL_DOCKER_IMAGE`) in `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` (if Docker-based)
- [ ] Temp files in `/tmp/redamon/`, cleaned up in `finally` block
- [ ] Frontend section component in `webapp/src/components/projects/ProjectForm/sections/`
- [ ] Section imported and rendered in `ProjectForm.tsx` under the correct tab
- [ ] Section exported from `sections/index.ts`
- [ ] `SECTION_INPUT_MAP` and `SECTION_NODE_MAP` updated in `nodeMapping.ts` (if new section)
- [ ] `/defaults` endpoint updated in `recon_orchestrator/api.py`
- [ ] Graph DB: update or extend the appropriate `update_graph_from_*()` method in `graph_db/neo4j_client.py`
- [ ] **Graph node reuse**: Before creating new node labels, check if the tool's output can be mapped to **existing** node types in `readmes/GRAPH.SCHEMA.md`. For example, discovered hostnames should go into `Subdomain`, not a new label. Only introduce new node labels if the data genuinely doesn't fit any existing type.
- [ ] If the tool introduces **new node labels, relationship types, or node properties** to the graph, update **ALL** of these:
  1. `readmes/GRAPH.SCHEMA.md` — the canonical schema reference
  2. `agentic/prompts/base.py` — the `TEXT_TO_CYPHER_SYSTEM` prompt (LLM-facing schema for natural-language-to-Cypher). Missing this will cause the agent to generate incorrect queries or fail to expose new data.
  3. `webapp/src/app/graph/config/colors.ts` — add entry to `NODE_COLORS` dict with an appropriate color for the new node type (read existing color families as reference)
  4. `webapp/src/app/graph/config/colors.ts` — add entry to `NODE_SIZES` if the new node type needs a non-default size
  5. `webapp/src/app/graph/components/DataTable/DataTableToolbar.tsx` — add the new node type to the type filter dropdown so users can filter by it
  6. `webapp/src/app/graph/components/PageBottomBar/PageBottomBar.tsx` — add the new node type to the legend if applicable
- [ ] If tool needs API keys: add field to `UserSettings` model in Prisma, fetch at runtime via `_fetch_user_api_key()`, show key status banner in frontend section
- [ ] If tool is active (sends traffic to target): add overrides in `apply_stealth_overrides()` in `recon/project_settings.py`
- [ ] If tool is involved in subdomain enumeration: results may include out-of-scope subdomains (e.g., related but not under the target root domain). These must be split into in-scope `subdomains` vs `external_domains` — follow the existing pattern in `recon/domain_recon.py` where discovered subdomains are checked against the target domain and out-of-scope entries are collected separately as external domains
- [ ] **Logging format**: All `print()` log lines MUST follow the standard `[symbol][ToolName] message` format used throughout the recon pipeline. The symbol prefix indicates the log level/type:
   - `[*][ToolName]` — informational / progress (e.g., `[*][Naabu] Starting scan...`)
   - `[+][ToolName]` — success / positive result (e.g., `[+][Subfinder] Found 42 subdomains`)
   - `[-][ToolName]` — negative result or skipped (e.g., `[-][crt.sh] Disabled — skipping`)
   - `[!][ToolName]` — error / warning (e.g., `[!][Amass] Error: timeout`)
   - `[✓][ToolName]` — completed / verified (e.g., `[✓][Naabu] Image already available`)
   - `[⚡]` — special mode indicator (e.g., `[⚡] BRUTEFORCE MODE`)

   See `recon/domain_recon.py`, `recon/port_scan.py`, `recon/whois_recon.py` for reference. Never use bare `print()` without the `[symbol][ToolName]` prefix.
- [ ] Error handling: try/except with timeout, Docker/binary not found, API errors — follow existing patterns
- [ ] Build and test: `docker compose build recon` then run a scan
